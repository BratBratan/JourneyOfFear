Journey of Fear
===============

All the source code and assets for Journey of Fear. It's kinda a mess but it's all here.

We don't have any releases yet, if you want to try it then you have to build it yourself.

Preliminary multiplayer will be coming out soon (hopefully). We still have a significant amount of kinks to work out (you try writing a server in Java) but we're getting there!
