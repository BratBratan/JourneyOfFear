S - Yeah right now the code in the ImageMask constructor is kinda broken,
     if you want you can try to fix it. What I tried to do is have only the
	 outlines of the masks, assuming that if a point is surrounded by others
	 it is unnecessary (unless objects are inside of each other), but I gave
	 up because the whole idea doesn't do anything at all.
