This is my code dump from school. Since I can't do work from school I'll write stuff here then integrate it into the code at home.

Player:

private int[] comboArray = new int[6];

attack:
    comboList = shift(direction);
    testCombo();
    testNextCombo();
    
private int[] shift(int val) {
    for (int i=comboArray.length-1;i>0;i--)
        comboArray[i] = comboArray[i-1];
    comboArray[0] = qq;
}

private boolean isCombo() {
    for (Combo c : Combos) {
        for ()
    }
}
